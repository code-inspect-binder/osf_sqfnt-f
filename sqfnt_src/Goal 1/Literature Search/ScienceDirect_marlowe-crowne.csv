The state forgiveness measures include self-report measures, chemical measures of state unforgiveness and forgiveness, measures of peripheral physiology (i.e., blood pressure, heart rate, skin conductance, and electrical activity of facial muscles) to supplement self-reports – unforgiveness, measures of brain activity associated with forgiveness, and behavioral indices of forgiveness. We also review a ten-item scale and a five-scenario scale of dispositional forgivingness. Self-forgiveness may also be assessed at state (one measure) and trait levels (one measure). These measures of forgiveness and their various targets (self or other) and different levels (state or trait) are generally strong – with considerable evidence supporting estimated reliabilities and construct validities.","forgiveness, forgivingness, measures, scales, self-forgiveness, state self-forgiveness, trait self-forgivingness"

Disentangling peer influence into two forms—informational influence and normative influence—this research examines their differential effects on two aspects of music piracy: unauthorized downloading and unauthorized sharing. The findings suggest that informational influence is the key underlying mechanism through which self-control affects unauthorized downloading, whereas the two forms of peer influence mediate the relationship between differential association and both aspects of music piracy. Furthermore, the relationships among antecedents, mediator, and consequences (i.e., unauthorized downloading and unauthorized sharing) are contingent upon individuals' self-construal. These findings yield important implications and intervention programs (e.g., interpersonal skill training, educational extension programs, and artist-student contact points) that can curb music piracy.","Unauthorized sharing, Unauthorized downloading, Peer influence in music downloading/sharing, Self-control, Differential association, Self-construal"
