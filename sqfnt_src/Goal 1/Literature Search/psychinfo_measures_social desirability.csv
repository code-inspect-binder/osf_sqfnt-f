In previous studies these objects were always external to the agent. However, relevant knowledge of self is also potentially accessible during goal pursuit, as self-esteem is an indicator of aim’s feasibility. In two experimental studies we tested whether goal activation affects temporal changes in automatic evaluations of personality traits related to the dimensions of agency and communion. We administered affect misattribution procedure where participants rated neutral Chinese hexagrams proceeded by words describing traits (75 ms masked presentation). The list of words comprised agentic (e.g. agile) and communal (e.g. trustworthy) traits. The rating took place twice—before and after introducing a manual task. In the first study, goal activation led to slightly more positive implicit evaluations of agentic and more negative evaluation of communal traits, which is consistent with empirical data on self-perception depending on agentic knowledge rather than communal one. In the second study we showed that goal activation led to changes only for promotion-, but not prevention-oriented individuals, which is explained by motivation strength. The results indicate that valuation of traits changes temporarily along with goal pursuit.

The descriptive statistics and reliability estimates of the SCMS were replicated in the current sample. In terms of construct validity, convergent validity was obtained with mindfulness, positive affect, negative affect, life satisfaction, depression, stress, and anxiety. Likewise, discriminant construct validity was obtained with social desirability, irrational beliefs, and anxiety sensitivity. Furthermore, the three-factor structure of the SCMS was supported by a confirmatory factor analysis. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that the SCMS is a robust measure of self-management and should be considered a viable measure in future research and applied settings.

When the above article was first published online, the words 'Divine struggles' in the beginning of the title were missing. This has now been corrected in both the print and online versions of the article.] Many people experience divine struggle—negative thoughts or feelings about God. This study examined connections between divine struggle (anger toward God; concern about God's disapproval), body image concerns, binge eating, and compensatory behaviours (purging, fasting, exercise) among undergraduates (N = 413; 47% women). Measures of divine struggle showed weak, inconsistent links with binge eating but consistent positive links with body image concerns and compensatory behaviours. These associations were not moderated by gender and remained significant when controlling 16 relevant variables (e.g., personality, self-concept, depression, religiousness). Body image/eating variables explained 9–11% of variance in current divine struggles. Binging correlated positively with protest and anger suppression toward God but also with approach behaviours. Compensatory behaviours correlated positively with protest, disengagement, and anger suppression. Spiritual grandiosity – seeing oneself as having a special/superior relationship with God – predicted more compensatory behaviours. Some nonbelievers also reported divine struggles, and these were associated with body image/eating disturbances.

(2) What is the evidence for their effectiveness within such settings? (3) What implementation issues arise when transporting EBPs into RCS? Methods: Evidence-based psychosocial interventions and respective outcome studies, published from 1990 to 2012, were identified through a multi-phase search process, involving the review of four major clearinghouse websites and relevant electronic databases. To be included, effectiveness had to have been previously established through a comparison group design regardless of the setting, and interventions tested subsequently with youth in RCS. All outcome studies were evaluated for quality and bias using a structured appraisal tool. Results: Ten interventions matching a priori criteria were identified: Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach, Aggression Replacement Training, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, Ecologically-Based Family Therapy, Eye Movement and Desensitization Therapy, Functional Family Therapy, Multimodal Substance Abuse Prevention, Residential Student Assistance Program, Solution-Focused Brief Therapy, and Trauma Intervention Program for Adjudicated and At-Risk Youth. Interventions were tested in 13 studies, which were conducted in different types of RCS, using a variety of study methods. Outcomes were generally positive, establishing the relative effectiveness of the interventions with youth in RCS across a range of psychosocial outcomes. However, concerns about methodological bias and confounding factors remain. Most studies addressed implementation issues, reporting on treatment adaptations, training and supervision, treatment fidelity and implementation barriers. Conclusion: The review unearthed a small but important body of knowledge that demonstrates that EBPs can be implemented in RCS with encouraging results.

To gain a better understanding of the beneficial effects of practising mindfulness, the study additionally examined how mindfulness and self-control were related to each other during the training. Methods: The randomised controlled trial combined a 40-day ecological momentary assessment with seven weekly surveys. Undergraduate students (Nenrolled = 137, 104 females, Mage = 23.08, SD = 5.04 years), were either assigned to the UBM training (n = 68) or wait-list control condition (n = 69). Primary outcomes were assessed six times a day using ecological momentary assessments (7-point scales). Secondary outcomes were measured weekly (6-point scales). A breath counting task at pre- and post-training was an additional behavioural measure of mindfulness. Results: An intention-to-treat multivariate mixed model identified day-to-day training effects (group × days-interaction) on state mindfulness (b = .005, p = .001) and perceived state self-control (b = .007, p < .001). A mediation analysis revealed that state mindfulness mediated the training effect on perceived state self-control (b = .001, p < .001). Habitual mindfulness (b = .049, p < .001) and breath counting task performance (b = 2.446, p = .043) also improved with training whereas habitual perceived self-control did not. Conclusions: These findings suggest that state mindfulness and perceived state self-control may be interconnected in daily life and may be similarly improved through an UBM training.

They found that sex drive is highly and positively correlated with sociosexual orientation, and that both sex drive and sociosexual orientation are positively correlated with lifetime number of sex partners. However, partial correlations revealed that sociosexual orientation is an independent predictor of lifetime number of sex partners, whereas sex drive is not. The authors were also able to replicate and extend Mikach and Bailey's (1999) finding that gender identity is related to women's lifetime number of sex partners. More masculine women had more sex partners and had a less restricted sociosexual orientation than did less masculine women; less masculine men had a higher sex drive than did more masculine men. The findings are discussed with regard to theory and research on sex drive and sociosexuality.

Design: University students, who stated that they have not been exercising regularly for at least one month, filled in a trait self-control inventory, a personality questionnaire, and were instructed to perform a daily workout over a one-week period. Perceived stress levels, state self-control strength, and workout completion were assessed on a daily basis. Results: Results revealed that people were less likely to exercise on days they perceived as stressful. State self-control mediated the relation between stress and exercise completion.

Personality traits such as low self-control are mostly indexed by self-report measures. However, several theorists emphasized the importance of differentiating between explicit and implicit indices of personality traits, Therefore, the present study examined the unique predictive validity of an implicit measure of trait self-control for spontaneous dysfunctional behavior. Methods: As a measure of implicit trait self-control, we used an irrelevant feature task: a speeded reaction time task comprising a task-relevant stimulus feature (i.e., capital vs. lower case letter type) and a task-irrelevant feature (high vs. low self-control word type). The irrelevant feature had to be ignored, while participants (n = 34) responded to the relevant stimulus feature. However, their response was either congruent or incongruent with the irrelevant stimulus feature, resulting in facilitated or deteriorated task performance. As indicators of trait-related spontaneous dysfunctional behavior, we included indices of frustration tolerance and the preference for short-term reward over meeting long-term goals. We also included two explicit measures of trait self-control: a self-report questionnaire and an explicit self-relevance rating of the implicit task stimuli. Results: Specifically the implicit measure of trait self-control showed predictive validity for the target self-control behaviors. Limitations: The predictive validity of implicit measures of personality traits requires further study in larger, non-student samples. Conclusions: As predicted, the implicit measure of trait self-control showed superior predictive power for spontaneous trait-related behavior. This finding points to the relevance of complementing the routinely used self-report measures with implicit measures of trait self-control.

Recently, it has been shown that undermining free-will beliefs influences social behavior. In the study reported here, we investigated whether undermining beliefs in free will affects brain correlates of voluntary motor preparation. Our results showed that the readiness potential was reduced in individuals induced to disbelieve in free will. This effect was evident more than 1 s before participants consciously decided to move, a finding that suggests that the manipulation influenced intentional actions at preconscious stages.

It is widely believed that these processes are critical to self‐control and, therefore, that performance on behavioural task measures of EF should be associated with individual differences in everyday life outcomes. The purpose of the present study was to test this assumption, focusing on the core executive function facet of inhibition. A sample of 463 undergraduates completed five laboratory inhibition tasks, along with three self‐report measures of self‐control and 28 self‐report measures of life outcomes. Results showed that although most of the life outcome measures were associated with self‐reported self‐control, only one of the outcomes was associated with inhibition task performance at the latent‐variable level, and this association was in the unexpected direction. Furthermore, few associations were found at the individual task level. These findings challenge the criterion validity of lab‐based inhibition tasks. More generally, when considered alongside the known lack of convergent validity between inhibition tasks and self‐report measures of self‐control, the findings cast doubt on the task's construct validity as measures of self‐control processes. Potential methodological and theoretical reasons for the poor performance of laboratory‐based inhibition tasks are discussed.

This study used multilevel modeling of data from a randomized controlled trial in an exploratory analysis to assess whether patient factors moderated the impact of peer support and pager reminders on ART adherence and biological markers of HIV. According to 272 interaction models using an alpha-corrected significance criteria, none of 34 patient characteristics significantly moderated either intervention.

Abundant research has examined the negative consequences of being the target of sexual objectification; however, limited attention has focused on the person doing the objectification. Our focus is on the agent and how self‐regulatory resources influence sexual objectification. Consistent with prior evidence, we reasoned that people have a well‐learned automatic response to objectify sexualized women, and as such, we expected objectifying a sexualized (vs. personalized) woman would deplete fewer regulatory resources than not objectifying her. Findings across three studies confirmed our expectations, demonstrating the extent to which people objectify a sexualized woman or not is influenced by the availability of regulatory resources, a case that heretofore has been absent from the literature. These patterns are discussed in the context of the sexual objectification and self‐regulation literature.

Aim: To investigate the extent to which self-control is a component of resident professionalism, rated both by residents and their program directors. Methods: 366 residents in 13 residency programs were invited to participate in a survey study of professionalism. Participating residents completed the Professionalism—Documentation of Competence (ProDOC) (a 15-item measure of professionalism developed for the study), a 10-item version of the Marlowe–Crowne Social Desirability Scale, and the Brief Self-Control Scale. Independently, program directors of participating residents completed the ProDOC with reference to each of their participating residents. Results: 215 residents agreed to participate in the study (58.7% response rate). Resident ProDOC scores were significantly related to social desirability and self-control. Self-control alone accounted for approximately 25% of the variance in resident ProDOC scores, and approximately 17% of the variance in ProDOC scores when shared variance with social desirability was controlled. There was no correlation between resident and program director ProDOC scores. Conclusions: Self-control is an important facet of human behavior and interpersonal interaction, including the behaviors that constitute medical professionalism. The lack of correlation between residents’ self-ratings of professionalism and their program directors’ ratings underscores the difficulty in understanding and measuring this competency.

The purpose of this study was to investigate online and offline deviant behavior in a sample of high school students, as well as compare a number of theoretical frameworks for predicting deviance. Employing structural equation modeling, the findings of the study indicated that one’s normative beliefs or psychological factors are more important than social factors when it comes to deviant behavior. Attitudes toward violence, low self-control, and peer attachment were positively associated with offline deviance, while parental attachment and neighborhood attachment had negative associations. For online deviance, toxic online disinhibition and attitudes toward violence were positive predictors, while parental attachment had a negative association.

Evidence for construct validity was found in relation to the Big Five personality traits, self-control, and IQ. Evidence for criterion validity was found via the observation that grit explained unique variance in academic performance. Together, the Grit-S is a sound measure of grit among Chinese adolescents.

People induced to disbelieve in free will show impulsive and antisocial tendencies, suggesting a reduction of the willingness to exert self-control. We investigated whether undermining free will affects two aspects of self-control: intentional inhibition and perceived self-control. We exposed participants either to anti-free will or to neutral messages. The two groups (no-free will and control) then performed a task that required self-control to inhibit a prepotent response. No-free will participants showed less intentional inhibitions than controls, suggesting a reduction of self-control. We assessed perceived self-control by asking participants whether the response resulted from a deliberate intention or from an impulsive reaction. Perceived self-control was lower in the no-free will group than in control group. Our findings show that undermining free will can degrade self-control and provide insights into how disbelieving in free will leads to antisocial tendencies.

Trait self‐control at baseline was positively associated with social desirability at a follow‐up, even when controlling for prior levels of social desirability. That is, high self‐control contributed to individuals' tendency to give socially desirable responses in self‐reports. This effect was moderated by individual differences in agreeableness. Highly agreeable individuals were more likely to 'use' their self‐regulatory resources to respond in a socially desirable manner, compared to less agreeable individuals, suggesting that individuals might use self‐regulatory resources in a way consistent with the motivational bases of their personality.

Items were adapted from the Brief Self-Control Scale (BSCS; Tangney, Baumeister, & Boone, 2004) and administered through 2 online surveys to 347 students and 1 online survey to 192 participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk. The Multidimensional Assessment of Self-Control showed strong evidence for the reliability of test scores and the validity of the interpretation of test scores. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a 3-factor structure consistent with the underlying theoretical model. The final 15-item measure demonstrated excellent model fit. The 3 subscales related to various self-reported behavioral outcomes and accounted for additional variance beyond that accounted for by the BSCS. Although more research in this area is needed, the current study demonstrates the importance of studying multiple aspects of self-control, including self-control motivation. Future research might use this measure to elucidate mechanisms involved in self-control for various health-risk and protective behaviors. Such findings might ultimately inform tailoring of prevention and intervention efforts to be more specific, effective, and efficient.

This study sought to explore the relationships between self-control, reports of mental and physical health symptoms and coping styles. The results revealed that higher self-control was related to fewer mental and physical health symptoms and less avoidance coping. There was not a significant relationship between self-control and problem-focused or emotion-focused coping styles. Further, the relationships between self-control and mental and physical health outcomes were partially mediated by avoidance coping style. Specifically, the data suggest lower self-control is associated with unhealthy coping strategies (avoidance coping), which in turn are associated with worse mental health outcomes and greater reports of physical health symptoms. Thus lower trait self-control can serve as an indicator, suggesting circumstances in which individuals’ tendencies to engage in unhealthy coping strategies are increased. These findings add to a growing body of literature underscoring the importance of trait self-control.
