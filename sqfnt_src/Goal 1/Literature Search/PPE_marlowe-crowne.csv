"Evaluating the Big Five as an organizing framework for commonly used psychological trait scales.","Bainbridge, Timothy F.; Ludeke, Steven G.; Smillie, Luke D.","Journal of Personality and Social Psychology",="00223514",,="20220401","122","4","749","29","2022-21018-001","10.1037/pspp0000395","American Psychological Association","Journal Article","Five Factor Personality Model; Persistence; Personality Traits; Self-Esteem; Taxonomies; Labeling; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Thirties (30-39 yrs); Middle Age (40-64 yrs); Aged (65 yrs & older); Male; Female",,"The Big Five is often represented as an effective taxonomy of psychological traits, yet little research has empirically examined whether stand-alone assessments of psychological traits can be located within the Big Five framework. Meanwhile, construct proliferation has created difficulty navigating the resulting landscape. In the present research, we developed criteria for assessing whether the Big Five provides a comprehensive organizing framework for psychological trait scales and evaluated this question across three samples (Total N = 1,039). Study 1 revealed that 83% of an author-identified collection of scales (e.g., Self-Esteem, Grit, etc.) were as related to the Big Five as at least four of 30 Big Five facets, and Study 2 found that 71% of scales selected based on citation counts passed the same criterion. Several scales had strikingly large links at the Big Five facet level, registering correlations with individual Big Five facets exceeding .9. We conclude that the Big Five can indeed serve as an organizing framework for a sizable majority of stand-alone psychological trait scales and that many of these scales could reasonably be labeled as facets of the Big Five. We suggest an integrative pluralism approach, where reliable, valid scales are located within the Big Five and pertinent Big Five research is considered in all research using trait scales readily located within the Big Five. By adopting such an approach, construct proliferation may be abated and it would become easier to integrate findings from disparate fields.

"Explaining the relationship between religiousness and substance use: Self-control matters.","DeWall, C. Nathan; Pond, Richard S.

Building on prior theoretical work, our studies suggest that self-control mediates the relationship between religiousness and a variety of substance-use behaviors. Study 1 showed that daily prayer predicted lower alcohol use on subsequent days. In Study 2, religiousness related to lower alcohol use, which was mediated by self-control. Study 3 replicated this mediational pattern using a behavioral measure of self-control. Using a longitudinal design, Study 4 revealed that self-control mediated the relationship between religiousness and lower alcohol use 6 weeks later. Study 5 replicated this mediational pattern again and showed that it remained significant after controlling for trait mindfulness. Studies 6 and 7 replicated and extended these effects to both alcohol and various forms of drug use among community and cross-cultural adult samples. These findings offer novel evidence regarding the role of self-control in explaining why religiousness is associated with lower substance use.

"Self-control relies on glucose as a limited energy source: Willpower is more than a metaphor.","Gailliot, Matthew T.; Baumeister, Roy F.; DeWall, C. Nathan; Maner, Jon K.; Plant, E.

Laboratory tests of self-control (i.e., the Stroop task, thought suppression, emotion regulation, attention control) and of social behaviors (i.e., helping behavior, coping with thoughts of death, stifling prejudice during an interracial interaction) showed that (a) acts of self-control reduced blood glucose levels, (b) low levels of blood glucose after an initial self-control task predicted poor performance on a subsequent self-control task, and (c) initial acts of self-control impaired performance on subsequent self-control tasks, but consuming a glucose drink eliminated these impairments. Self-control requires a certain amount of glucose to operate unimpaired. A single act of self-control causes glucose to drop below optimal levels, thereby impairing subsequent attempts at self-control.

"Taking the long view: Implications of individual differences in temporal distancing for affect, stress reactivity, and well-being.","Bruehlman-Senecal, Emma; Ayduk, Özlem; John, Oliver P.","Journal of Personality and Social Psychology",="00223514",,="20161001","111","4","610","26","2016-33915-001","10.1037/pspp0000103","American Psychological Association","Journal Article","Experiences (Events); Individual Differences; Questionnaires; Test Construction; Psychological Distance; Cognitive Appraisal; Emotional Regulation; Stress; Test Reliability; Time Perspective; Well Being; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Male; Female",,"Recent experimental work demonstrates that temporal distancing from negative experiences reduces distress. Yet two central questions remain: (a) do people differ in the habitual tendency to temporally distance from negative experiences, and if so (b) what implications does this tendency have for well-being? Seven studies explored these questions. Study 1 describes the construction and reliability of the Temporal Distancing Questionnaire, a new measure of individual differences in the tendency to place negative experiences into a broader future time perspective. Study 2 establishes a nomological network around this construct, examining the relationship of temporal distancing to other theoretically related constructs. Study 3 tests whether people high in temporal distancing (i.e., 'high temporal distancers') experience greater concurrent well-being, including greater positive affect and life satisfaction and lesser negative affect, worry, and depressive symptoms. Study 4 examines whether temporal distancing predicts well-being measured at the daily level, and across time. Finally, Studies 5a–5c explore a key way in which temporal distancing may support psychological well-being—by facilitating more adaptive responses to negative experiences. Our results demonstrate that the tendency to temporally distance from negative experiences predicts a more positive profile of affective experiences and stress-reactivity that may support immediate and longer-term well-being. Moreover, many of these findings remained significant when controlling for general reappraisal tendencies.

"The MASC: A novel multidimensional measure of self-control.","Papova, Anna; Corbin, William R.","Motivation Science",="23338113",,="20201201","6","4","346","13","2020-02046-001","10.1037/mot0000163","Educational Publishing Foundation","Journal Article","Measurement; Motivation; Self-Control; Test Construction; Test Scores; Extrinsic Motivation; Intrinsic Motivation; Test Reliability; Test Validity; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Male; Female",,"The current study seeks to create a brief survey measure of self-control that differentiates perceived capacity from internal and external motivation. Items were adapted from the Brief Self-Control Scale (BSCS; Tangney, Baumeister, & Boone, 2004) and administered through 2 online surveys to 347 students and 1 online survey to 192 participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk. The Multidimensional Assessment of Self-Control showed strong evidence for the reliability of test scores and the validity of the interpretation of test scores. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a 3-factor structure consistent with the underlying theoretical model. The final 15-item measure demonstrated excellent model fit. The 3 subscales related to various self-reported behavioral outcomes and accounted for additional variance beyond that accounted for by the BSCS. Although more research in this area is needed, the current study demonstrates the importance of studying multiple aspects of self-control, including self-control motivation. Future research might use this measure to elucidate mechanisms involved in self-control for various health-risk and protective behaviors. Such findings might ultimately inform tailoring of prevention and intervention efforts to be more specific, effective, and efficient.

"Validating the voodoo doll task as a proxy for aggressive parenting behavior.","McCarthy, Randy J.; Crouch, Julie L.; Basham, Ariel R.; Milner, Joel S.; Skowronski, John J.","Psychology of Violence",="21520828",,="20160101","6","1","135","10","2014-49432-001","10.1037/a0038456","Educational Publishing Foundation","Journal Article","Aggressive Behavior; Parenting; Child Abuse; Physical Abuse; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Male; Female",,"Objective: Six studies (N = 1,081 general population parents) assessed the validity of the voodoo doll task (VDT) as a proxy for aggressive parenting behaviors. Method: Participants were given an opportunity to symbolically inflict harm by choosing to stick 'pins' into a doll representing their child. Results: Individual differences in parents’ trait aggression (Studies 1, 2, and 6), state hostility (Study 3), attitudes toward the corporal punishment of children (Study 4), self-control (Study 6), depression (Study 6), and child physical abuse risk (Study 6) were associated with increased pin usage. Further, parents used more pins after imagining their child performing negative behaviors compared to after imagining their child perform positive behaviors (Study 5). A number of demographic variables also were associated with pin usage: Fathers used pins more than mothers and parents’ education level was inversely related to pin usage. Finally, on average, parents viewed the VDT as slightly uncomfortable, but not objectionable, to complete (Study 6). Conclusions: Our evidence suggests that the VDT may serve as a useful proxy for parent-to-child aggression.
