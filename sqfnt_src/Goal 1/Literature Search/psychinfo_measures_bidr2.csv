A variety of studies shows that the successful exertion of self-control depends on the momentary availability of self-control strength. For the assessment of momentary self-control strength in German speaking samples, the State Self-Control Capacity Scale was adapted into German. In the present work, five studies are presented in which the psychometric properties of this scale were tested. Across all studies, the one-dimensional scale turned out to be very reliable (Cronbach's alphas ≥ .93). In terms of its validity, expected relations with validity criteria (e.g., anxiety, stress, time already spent in courses) could be demonstrated. In addition, the empirical separation from different aspects of mood was successful. Furthermore, the new scale indicated induced differences in self-control strength, both (quasi-) experimentally in the lab and the field (university). A short scale consisting of ten items also proved to be sufficiently reliable and valid.

"Neural correlates of self-focused and other-focused strategies for coping with cigarette cue exposure.","Wilson, Stephen J.; Sayette, Michael A.; Fiez, Julie A.","Psychology of Addictive Behaviors",="0893164X",="1433816350",="20130601","27","2","466","11","2012-02612-001","10.1037/a0027055","American Psychological Association","Journal Article","Coping Behavior; Craving; Cues; Tobacco Smoking; Exposure; Neurocognition; Strategies; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Thirties (30-39 yrs); Middle Age (40-64 yrs); Male",,"Brain imaging research has begun to characterize the neurocognitive processes that cigarette smokers utilize to cope with cue-elicited craving. Presently, however, it remains unclear whether distinct neural substrates support different types of coping. We sought to address this knowledge gap by examining neural responses associated with self-focused and other-focused coping techniques. Fifty-seven treatment-seeking male cigarette smokers initiated an attempt to quit smoking and subsequently underwent functional MRI, during which they were asked to hold and view neutral cues and a cigarette. Participants were instructed to engage in either self-focused or other-focused coping while being presented with the cigarette and an opportunity to smoke. Those who were told to engage in self-focused coping, but not those told to utilize other-focused coping, exhibited significant activation of several regions previously implicated in self-referential processing, including the medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and insula. In addition, coping strategy modulated the relationship between cigarette-related brain activation and self-reported craving in a subset of these regions. These findings indicate that coping strategies that entail the generation and maintenance of self-relevant information rely upon different psychological and neurobiological mechanisms than those that are not self-focused, even when the latter incorporate information that is very similar in content. Results extend previous work examining the neural substrates of coping with craving. Given the potential mnemonic and motivational advantages associated with self-related processing, findings may have significant implications for selecting and improving techniques for helping quitting smokers resist the urge to smoke.

This study seeks to understand the religious and psychological underpinnings of patience and presents the Patience Scale to measure individual differences in the trait. Undergraduate psychology students (n = 324) completed survey packets containing items to measure patience as well as the Values in Action Strengths Scale (VIA-IS), measures of religiousness/spirituality, and measures of self-control, time perspective, the Big Five, and mindfulness. The 24 strengths of the VIA-IS were related in varying degrees to patience, but sufficient independence from existing strengths was demonstrated. Patience was significantly related to spiritual transcendence and to religious behaviors. Anticipated uses of the Patience Scale and implications for future research are discussed.

"Predicting pornography use over time: Does self-reported 'addiction' matter?","Grubbs, Joshua B.; Wilt, Joshua A.; Exline, Julie J.; Pargament, Kenneth I.","Addictive Behaviors",="03064603",,="20180701","82",,"57","8","2018-14614-011","10.1016/j.addbeh.2018.02.028","Elsevier Science","Journal Article","Addiction; Distress; Pornography; Self-Report; Test Construction; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Male; Female",,"In recent years, several works have reported on perceived addiction to internet pornography, or the potential for some individuals to label their own use of pornography as compulsive or out of control. Such works have consistently found that perceived addiction is related to concerning outcomes such as psychological distress, relational distress, and other addictive behaviors. However, very little work has specifically examined whether or not perceived addiction is actually related to increased use of pornography, cross-sectionally or over time. The present work sought to address this deficit in the literature. Using two longitudinal samples (Sample 1, Baseline N = 3988; Sample 2, Baseline N = 1047), a variety of factors (e.g., male gender, lower religiousness, and lower self-control) were found to predict any use of pornography. Among those that acknowledged use (Sample 1, Baseline N = 1352; Sample 2, Baseline N = 793), perceived addiction to pornography consistently predicted greater average daily use of pornography. At subsequent longitudinal follow-ups (Sample 1, Baseline N = 265; Sample 2, One Month Later, N = 410, One Year Later, N = 360), only male gender and baseline average pornography use consistently predicted future use. These findings suggest that perceived addiction to pornography is associated with concurrent use of pornography, but does not appear to predict use over time, suggesting that perceived addiction may not always be an accurate indicator of behavior or addiction.

"Quitting-unmotivated and quitting-motivated cigarette smokers exhibit different patterns of cue-elicited brain activation when anticipating an opportunity to smoke.","Wilson, Stephen J.; Sayette, Michael A.; Fiez, Julie A.","Journal of Abnormal Psychology",="0021843X",,="20120201","121","1","198","14","2011-18195-001","10.1037/a0025112","American Psychological Association","Journal Article","Brain; Cues; Drug Addiction; Smoking Cessation; Tobacco Smoking; Motivation; Neuroimaging; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Thirties (30-39 yrs); Middle Age (40-64 yrs); Male; Female",,"The authors examined the effects of smoking expectancy on cue-reactivity among those motivated and those unmotivated to quit smoking using functional MRI. Cue-elicited activation was observed in the rostral prefrontal cortex (PFC) in smokers who expected to smoke within seconds, but not in those who expected to have to wait hours before having the chance to smoke, regardless of quitting motivation. For quitting-unmotivated smokers expecting to smoke, rostral PFC activation was strongly positively correlated with the activation of several areas previously linked to cue-reactivity, including the medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In contrast, there was a nonsignificant negative relationship between activation of the rostral PFC and activation of the medial OFC/rostral ACC in quitting-motivated smokers expecting to smoke. Results extend previous work examining the effects of smoking expectancy and highlight the utility of examining interregional covariation during cue exposure. Findings also suggest that investigators may need to pay close attention to the motivational contexts associated with their experiments when studying cue-reactivity, as these contexts can modulate not only responses to drug cues, but perhaps also the functional implications of observed activity.

"The selfish side of self‐control.","Uziel, Liad; Hefetz, Uri","European Journal of Personality",="08902070",,="20140901","28","5","449","10","2014-33585-001","10.1002/per.1972","John Wiley & Sons","Journal Article","Prosocial Behavior; Rationality; Self-Control; Selfishness; Interpersonal Control; Thinking; Desire; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Male; Female",,"Self‐control is a powerful tool that promotes goal pursuit by helping individuals curb personal desires, follow norms, and adopt rational thinking. In interdependent social contexts, the socially acceptable (i.e. normative) and rational approach to secure long‐term goals is prosocial behaviour. Consistent with that, much research associates self‐control with prosociality. The present research demonstrates that when norm salience is reduced (i.e. social relations are no longer interdependent), high self‐control leads to more selfish behaviour when it is economically rational. In three studies, participants were asked to allocate an endowment between themselves and another person (one‐round, zero‐sum version of the dictator game), facing a conflict between a socially normative and an economically rational approach. Across the studies, norm salience was manipulated [through manipulation of social context (private/public; Studies 1 and 2), measurement of social desirability (Studies 1 and 3), and measurement (Study 2) and manipulation (Study 3) of social power] such that some participants experienced low normative pressure. Findings showed that among individuals in a low normative pressure context, self‐control led to economically rational, yet selfish, behaviour. The findings highlight the role of self‐control in regulating behaviour so as to maximize situational adaptation.
