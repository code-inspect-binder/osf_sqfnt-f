"Inducing disbelief in free will alters brain correlates of preconscious motor preparation: The brain minds whether we believe in free will or not.","Rigoni, Davide; Kühn, Simone; Sartori, Giuseppe; Brass, Marcel","Psychological Science",="09567976",,="20110501","22","5","613","6","2011-09890-009","10.1177/0956797611405680","Sage Publications","Journal Article","Brain; Motor Processes; Volition; Attitudes; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Male; Female",,"The feeling of being in control of one’s own actions is a strong subjective experience. However, discoveries in psychology and neuroscience challenge the validity of this experience and suggest that free will is just an illusion. This raises a question: What would happen if people started to disbelieve in free will? Previous research has shown that low control beliefs affect performance and motivation. Recently, it has been shown that undermining free-will beliefs influences social behavior. In the study reported here, we investigated whether undermining beliefs in free will affects brain correlates of voluntary motor preparation. Our results showed that the readiness potential was reduced in individuals induced to disbelieve in free will. This effect was evident more than 1 s before participants consciously decided to move, a finding that suggests that the manipulation influenced intentional actions at preconscious stages. Our findings indicate that abstract belief systems might have a much more fundamental effect than previously thought.

"Predicting pornography use over time: Does self-reported 'addiction' matter?","Grubbs, Joshua B.; Wilt, Joshua A.; Exline, Julie J.; Pargament, Kenneth I.","Addictive Behaviors",="03064603",,="20180701","82",,"57","8","2018-14614-011","10.1016/j.addbeh.2018.02.028","Elsevier Science","Journal Article","Addiction; Distress; Pornography; Self-Report; Test Construction; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Male; Female",,"In recent years, several works have reported on perceived addiction to internet pornography, or the potential for some individuals to label their own use of pornography as compulsive or out of control. Such works have consistently found that perceived addiction is related to concerning outcomes such as psychological distress, relational distress, and other addictive behaviors. However, very little work has specifically examined whether or not perceived addiction is actually related to increased use of pornography, cross-sectionally or over time. The present work sought to address this deficit in the literature. Using two longitudinal samples (Sample 1, Baseline N = 3988; Sample 2, Baseline N = 1047), a variety of factors (e.g., male gender, lower religiousness, and lower self-control) were found to predict any use of pornography. Among those that acknowledged use (Sample 1, Baseline N = 1352; Sample 2, Baseline N = 793), perceived addiction to pornography consistently predicted greater average daily use of pornography. At subsequent longitudinal follow-ups (Sample 1, Baseline N = 265; Sample 2, One Month Later, N = 410, One Year Later, N = 360), only male gender and baseline average pornography use consistently predicted future use. These findings suggest that perceived addiction to pornography is associated with concurrent use of pornography, but does not appear to predict use over time, suggesting that perceived addiction may not always be an accurate indicator of behavior or addiction.
