Furthermore, we test the prediction that the relation between NFC and school achievement is mediated by self-control capacity. A questionnaire study with grade ten high-school students (N=604) revealed the expected relations between NFC, self-control capacity, and school achievement. Sobel tests showed that self-control capacity mediated the relation between NFC and school grades as well as grade retention.","Need for cognition, Self-control, Self-regulation, School achievement"

Using materials that describe friendship-related challenges, potential ways of responding to them, and distinct frames targeting the acting self as well as more abstract ideas concerning effectiveness, three studies (total N = 542) quantified friendship-related ego effectiveness as a within-subject correlation between self-likelihood ratings and effectiveness ratings. Ego effective individuals reported higher levels of self-control (Study 1), were deemed to be more socially competent by peers (Study 2), and experienced higher levels of well-being in their daily lives (Study 3). The results highlight a form of alignment within the self-system that can be leveraged to understand variations in social behavior as well as social and emotional functioning.","Ego, Self-regulation, Situational judgment, Social behavior, Well-being"
