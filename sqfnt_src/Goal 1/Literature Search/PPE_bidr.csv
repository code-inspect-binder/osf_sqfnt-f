Based upon the tenets of Self-Determination Theory and aimed at measuring motivation in undergraduate students, the scale demonstrated a three-factor structure in exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (Study 1: N = 238, Study 2: N = 264, Study 3: N = 297). Factors corresponded to autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and amotivation. Preliminary evidence supported the validity of MPPRS scores, and subscales differentiated psychology majors from non-majors, as well as associated with the timing of research participation during the semester. Examining student motivation with the MPPRS has possible implications for data quality, as a moderator of research findings, and might be used to track changes in students’ interest regarding psychological research. However, future research is needed to assess the predictive validity of the MPPRS.

"Neural correlates of self-focused and other-focused strategies for coping with cigarette cue exposure.","Wilson, Stephen J.; Sayette, Michael A.; Fiez, Julie A.","Psychology of Addictive Behaviors",="0893164X",="1433816350",="20130601","27","2","466","11","2012-02612-001","10.1037/a0027055","American Psychological Association","Journal Article","Coping Behavior; Craving; Cues; Tobacco Smoking; Exposure; Neurocognition; Strategies; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Thirties (30-39 yrs); Middle Age (40-64 yrs); Male",,"Brain imaging research has begun to characterize the neurocognitive processes that cigarette smokers utilize to cope with cue-elicited craving. Presently, however, it remains unclear whether distinct neural substrates support different types of coping. We sought to address this knowledge gap by examining neural responses associated with self-focused and other-focused coping techniques. Fifty-seven treatment-seeking male cigarette smokers initiated an attempt to quit smoking and subsequently underwent functional MRI, during which they were asked to hold and view neutral cues and a cigarette. Participants were instructed to engage in either self-focused or other-focused coping while being presented with the cigarette and an opportunity to smoke. Those who were told to engage in self-focused coping, but not those told to utilize other-focused coping, exhibited significant activation of several regions previously implicated in self-referential processing, including the medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and insula. In addition, coping strategy modulated the relationship between cigarette-related brain activation and self-reported craving in a subset of these regions. These findings indicate that coping strategies that entail the generation and maintenance of self-relevant information rely upon different psychological and neurobiological mechanisms than those that are not self-focused, even when the latter incorporate information that is very similar in content. Results extend previous work examining the neural substrates of coping with craving. Given the potential mnemonic and motivational advantages associated with self-related processing, findings may have significant implications for selecting and improving techniques for helping quitting smokers resist the urge to smoke.

"Quitting-unmotivated and quitting-motivated cigarette smokers exhibit different patterns of cue-elicited brain activation when anticipating an opportunity to smoke.","Wilson, Stephen J.; Sayette, Michael A.; Fiez, Julie A.","Journal of Abnormal Psychology",="0021843X",,="20120201","121","1","198","14","2011-18195-001","10.1037/a0025112","American Psychological Association","Journal Article","Brain; Cues; Drug Addiction; Smoking Cessation; Tobacco Smoking; Motivation; Neuroimaging; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Thirties (30-39 yrs); Middle Age (40-64 yrs); Male; Female",,"The authors examined the effects of smoking expectancy on cue-reactivity among those motivated and those unmotivated to quit smoking using functional MRI. Cue-elicited activation was observed in the rostral prefrontal cortex (PFC) in smokers who expected to smoke within seconds, but not in those who expected to have to wait hours before having the chance to smoke, regardless of quitting motivation. For quitting-unmotivated smokers expecting to smoke, rostral PFC activation was strongly positively correlated with the activation of several areas previously linked to cue-reactivity, including the medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In contrast, there was a nonsignificant negative relationship between activation of the rostral PFC and activation of the medial OFC/rostral ACC in quitting-motivated smokers expecting to smoke. Results extend previous work examining the effects of smoking expectancy and highlight the utility of examining interregional covariation during cue exposure. Findings also suggest that investigators may need to pay close attention to the motivational contexts associated with their experiments when studying cue-reactivity, as these contexts can modulate not only responses to drug cues, but perhaps also the functional implications of observed activity.

"Role of self-control strength in the relation between anxiety and cognitive performance.","Bertrams, Alex; Englert, Chris; Dickhäuser, Oliver; Baumeister, Roy F.","Emotion",="15283542",,="20130801","13","4","668","13","2013-10203-001","10.1037/a0031921","American Psychological Association","Journal Article","Cognitive Ability; Performance Tests; Self-Control; Self-Regulation; Test Anxiety; Ego; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Male; Female",,"In the present work, we examine the role of self-control resources within the relationship between anxiety and cognitive test performance. We argue that self-control is required for keeping attention away from anxiety-related worries, which would otherwise distract a person from performing on the test. In Study 1 (N = 67) and Study 2 (N = 96), we found that state anxiety was negatively related to performance of verbal learning and mental arithmetic if participants’ self-control resources were depleted, but it was unrelated if participants’ self-control was intact. In Study 3 (N = 99), the worry component of trait test anxiety was more strongly related to perceived distraction by worries while performing an arithmetic task for participants with depleted self-control resources than for nondepleted participants. Furthermore, distraction by worries showed to be responsible for suboptimal performance. The findings may help to clarify the anxiety–performance relationship and offer a novel approach for counteracting performance decrements associated with test anxiety.

"Unethical for the sake of the group: Risk of social exclusion and pro-group unethical behavior.","Thau, Stefan; Derfler-Rozin, Rellie; Pitesa, Marko; Mitchell, Marie S.; Pillutla, Madan M.","Journal of Applied Psychology",="00219010",,="20150101","100","1","98","16","2014-14775-001","10.1037/a0036708","American Psychological Association","Journal Article","Antisocial Behavior; Ethics; Ingroup Outgroup; Motivation; Social Exclusion; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Male; Female",,"This research tested the idea that the risk of exclusion from one’s group motivates group members to engage in unethical behaviors that secure better outcomes for the group (pro-group unethical behaviors). We theorized that this effect occurs because those at risk of exclusion seek to improve their inclusionary status by engaging in unethical behaviors that benefit the group; we tested this assumption by examining how the effect of exclusion risk on pro-group unethical behavior varies as a function of group members’ need for inclusion. A 2-wave field study conducted among a diverse sample of employees working in groups (Study 1) and a constructive replication using a laboratory experiment (Study 2) provided converging evidence for the theory. Study 1 found that perceived risk of exclusion from one’s workgroup predicted employees’ engagement in pro-group unethical behaviors, but only when employees have a high (not low) need for inclusion. In Study 2, compared to low risk of exclusion from a group, high risk of exclusion led to more pro-group (but not pro-self) unethical behaviors, but only for participants with a high (not low) need for inclusion. We discuss implications for theory and the management of unethical behaviors in organizations.

"What makes people want more self-control: A duo of deficiency and necessity.","Uziel, Liad; Baumeister, Roy F.; Alquist, Jessica L.","Motivation Science",="23338113",,="20210901","7","3","242","10","2021-08169-001","10.1037/mot0000213","Educational Publishing Foundation","Journal Article","Causality; Goals; Motivation; Self-Control; Desire; Needs; Test Construction; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Male; Female",,"Self-control is important, but people may only be motivated to improve their self-control under specific conditions. The present study tests the factors that affect the desire for self-control (DSC), expecting that it would be affected by stable level of self-control (deficiency) and by concerns about meeting current goals (necessity). Four studies (total N = 676) tested the above hypothesis. Study 1 examined the nomological network of DSC, and Study 2 explored specifically its association with the need to exert self-control. Studies 3 and 4 tested experimentally the role of need to exert self-control in increasing DSC. Results revealed that DSC is associated with low trait self-control and with fear of failure (Study 1), and with concerns about meeting current goals (Study 2). Study 3 established causality, showing that DSC increased only among those who were led to believe that their self-control was insufficient to complete an upcoming task. In Study 4, DSC increased among participants who had completed a more (vs. less) demanding task, but only when they expected another demanding task. Jointly, the findings portray the different routes leading to a desire for self-control.
