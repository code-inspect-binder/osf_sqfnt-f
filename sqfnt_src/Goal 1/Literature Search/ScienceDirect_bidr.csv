Furthermore, we test the prediction that the relation between NFC and school achievement is mediated by self-control capacity. A questionnaire study with grade ten high-school students (N=604) revealed the expected relations between NFC, self-control capacity, and school achievement. Sobel tests showed that self-control capacity mediated the relation between NFC and school grades as well as grade retention.","Need for cognition, Self-control, Self-regulation, School achievement"

Four experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that humility predicts enhanced self-control. Participants who recalled humility experiences were found to be better able at sustaining their physical stamina in a handgrip task (Studies 1 and 4), resisting indulgence in chocolates (Study 2), and persevering in a frustrating tracing task (Study 3) than those who recalled neutral experiences. Studies 3 and 4 demonstrated that the effect of humility was distinct from that of self-esteem, which did not affect self-control. Study 2 ruled out two alternative hypotheses concerning achievement and compliance motives. We discuss how the findings might relate to outcomes associated with humility as evidenced in past studies.","Humility, Self-Control, Self-Esteem"

Although developmental psychopathology research suggests that self-regulatory temperament (e.g., effortful control or EC) mitigates reactive risks associated with negative affectivity (NA) and positive affectivity (PA), and their respective counterparts, behavioral inhibition- and activation sensitivity (BIS and BAS), no studies have established EC’s protective effects in adulthood. This study examined concurrent relations between temperament and distress symptoms shared by anxiety and depression, and anhedonic symptoms unique to depression, in young adults. Anticipated two- and three-way interactions emerged supporting EC’s moderating effect between reactive temperament (i.e., high BIS and low BAS) and both symptom dimensions. However, no interactive relations emerged between symptoms and NA, PA, and EC.","Effortful control, Emotional reactivity, Self-regulation, Anxiety, Depression"

Using materials that describe friendship-related challenges, potential ways of responding to them, and distinct frames targeting the acting self as well as more abstract ideas concerning effectiveness, three studies (total N = 542) quantified friendship-related ego effectiveness as a within-subject correlation between self-likelihood ratings and effectiveness ratings. Ego effective individuals reported higher levels of self-control (Study 1), were deemed to be more socially competent by peers (Study 2), and experienced higher levels of well-being in their daily lives (Study 3). The results highlight a form of alignment within the self-system that can be leveraged to understand variations in social behavior as well as social and emotional functioning.","Ego, Self-regulation, Situational judgment, Social behavior, Well-being"
