"Role of self-control strength in the relation between anxiety and cognitive performance.","Bertrams, Alex; Englert, Chris; Dickhäuser, Oliver; Baumeister, Roy F.","Emotion",="15283542",,="20130801","13","4","668","13","2013-10203-001","10.1037/a0031921","American Psychological Association","Journal Article","Cognitive Ability; Performance Tests; Self-Control; Self-Regulation; Test Anxiety; Ego; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Male; Female",,"In the present work, we examine the role of self-control resources within the relationship between anxiety and cognitive test performance. We argue that self-control is required for keeping attention away from anxiety-related worries, which would otherwise distract a person from performing on the test. In Study 1 (N = 67) and Study 2 (N = 96), we found that state anxiety was negatively related to performance of verbal learning and mental arithmetic if participants’ self-control resources were depleted, but it was unrelated if participants’ self-control was intact. In Study 3 (N = 99), the worry component of trait test anxiety was more strongly related to perceived distraction by worries while performing an arithmetic task for participants with depleted self-control resources than for nondepleted participants. Furthermore, distraction by worries showed to be responsible for suboptimal performance. The findings may help to clarify the anxiety–performance relationship and offer a novel approach for counteracting performance decrements associated with test anxiety.
