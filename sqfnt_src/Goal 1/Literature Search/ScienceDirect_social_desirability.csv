Our results demonstrate that individuals depleted of self-control resources were more likely to behave dishonestly (Study 1). Depletion reduced people’s moral awareness when they faced the opportunity to cheat, which, in turn, was responsible for heightened cheating (Study 2). Individuals high in moral identity, however, did not show elevated levels of cheating when they were depleted (Study 3), supporting our hypothesis that self-control depletion increases cheating when it robs people of the executive resources necessary to identify an act as immoral or unethical. Our results also show that resisting unethical behavior both requires and depletes self-control resources (Study 4). Taken together, our findings help to explain how otherwise ethical individuals predictably engage in unethical behavior.","Impulsive cheating, Unethical behavior, Ego depletion, Dishonesty, Self-control, Self-regulatory resources, Moral identity, Ethical decision making","",""

We then review contemporary approaches to studying intelligence as information processing. We conclude by proposing a broad agenda for integrating research on human capital resources with information processing approaches to intelligence.","Human capital resources, Intelligence, Information processing, Human resources","",""

In the present study, we tested the assumption that self-control strength is required to bridge the intention-behavior gap in terms of initial and weekly intentions. Design A total of N = 259 individuals, who registered for a weekly university sports course, were followed for 13 weeks. Methods At baseline, trait self-control strength as well as the intention to take part in the respective sports course on a regular basis were measured. Then, we registered weekly participation and asked the participants after each training session to report their intention to show up at next week’s training session. Results Despite very high baseline as well as weekly exercise intentions, the participation rate dropped considerably over time, indicating a large intention-behavior gap. The association of within-person fluctuations in weekly intentions and actual participation was moderated by self-control: Only in individuals with high levels of trait self-control strength stronger intentions were associated with a higher chance of actual re-attendance. Baseline intention was also associated with participation but not moderated by self-control. Conclusions These findings indicate that high levels of self-control strength are beneficial in order to translate short-term intentions into actual behavior. Practical implications on how to improve self-control are discussed.","Intention-behavior gap, Physical activity, Self-control, Self-regulation, Sport","",""

This hypothesis was systematically examined among three independent samples of participants (total N=176).

While states focus on removing children from danger, familial separation leaves a social void with negative impacts that can extend into adulthood. To better understand how youth in state custody navigate that social void, we interviewed 33 youth (aged 13–17) who were in CPS custody about their relationships with family, perceptions of role models and mentorship, and experiences with an arts-based mentorship organization. We also discussed their projected futures after CPS custody. The interviews took place in the field, during a two-week Theatre Camp program. Theatre Campers’ narratives illustrate the paradox between state benevolence and youth development: many felt safer in CPS, but encountered barriers to connecting with formal and informal support. They missed family, but also used them as examples of what not to do. Their unique perspectives (in state custody, but not incarcerated) provide insight into how marginalized youth view and engage with various forms of social support. We explore the implications of these findings for research at the intersection of criminology and social work, holistic juvenile justice policy, and social support over the life-course.","Criminology, Juvenile justice, Child welfare, Social support, Mentorship, Art therapy","",""

Specifically, we show that self-control capacity can be used to estimate whether a person immediately responds to a smartphone signal she receives.

Design A prospective design with two waves of data collection one week apart. Method An online survey measured the key components of TST (i.e., connectedness, timing and valence beliefs, intentions, past behaviour, habit strength, perceived environmental cues, and self-control) with respect to eating fruit and vegetables (F&V; N = 133) or unhealthy snacks (N = 125). Eating behaviour was assessed one week later. Results The components of TST explained significant amounts of the variance in intentions and behaviour for intake of F&Vs (22% and 64%, respectively) and unhealthy snacks (18% and 35%, respectively). Beliefs about positive and negative short-term outcomes significantly predicted intentions to perform both behaviours. Intentions and past behaviour significantly predicted consumption of F&Vs, and past behaviour moderated the relationship between intention and behaviour which became stronger as past behaviour increased. Past behaviour and habit strength significantly predicted unhealthy snacking. Conclusions The findings suggest that TST may be a useful framework for understanding eating intentions and behaviour. However, research did not find support for all of the hypothesised relationships (e.g., self-regulatory capacity did not significantly predict eating behaviour and also failed to moderate the relationships between intentions and behaviour). Research using alternative measures of self-regulatory capacity, along with experimental manipulations of TST variables, may be needed to further understand eating intentions and behaviour.","Fruit and vegetable intake, Habits, Past behaviour, Self-control, Temporal Self-Regulation theory, Snacking","",""

Less is known about whether the link between the 2D:4D ratio and violence holds for non-incarcerated populations, for females as well as males, and for general measures of violence. To address these issues, original data were collected on a sample of young adults to estimate the association between the 2D:4D ratio and self-reported violence. The study yielded two important findings. First, the 2D:4D ratio was associated with a majority of the individual violent behaviors examined, as well as multi-item measures of violence, in both bivariate and multivariate models. Second, the 2D:4D ratio was associated with violent behavior among separate samples of men and women, though associations were frequently non-statistically significant for females.","2D:4D, Prenatal testosterone, Violence, Aggression, Gender","",""

For this purpose, a sample of four hundred young drivers between the age group of 18–23 years was assessed on measures of sensation-seeking, impulsiveness and dangerous driving. The sample was further classified into male and female drivers. The constructs of sensation-seeking and impulsiveness were studied through their components or sub-scales. Therefore, sensation-seeking was assessed with its sub-scales of boredom susceptibility, experience seeking, disinhibition and thrill and adventure seeking while impulsiveness was gauged through attentional, motor and non-planning impulsiveness. The statistical analysis of correlation was performed to assess relationships amongst variables with stepwise multiple regression analysis for prediction of dangerous driving. The results of present investigation revealed positive correlations between all the variables assessed on the overall sample and amongst the groups of male and female drivers. Through regression analysis on the overall sample, disinhibition emerged to be the major predictor showing maximum variance followed by motor impulsiveness, attentional impulsiveness, non-planning impulsiveness and thrill and adventure seeking. Amongst male drivers, motor impulsiveness showed maximum variance for dangerous driving followed by disinhibition, attentional impulsiveness and non-planning impulsiveness. However, amongst female drivers, disinhibition was found to be the major predictor for dangerous driving having maximum variance followed by motor impulsiveness and attentional impulsiveness. The study gives a psychological insight into the dangerous driving behaviour of young drivers.

However, significant variability in maturation among individuals exists. The technology of cognitive/non-cognitive skill formation suggests that the growth of non-cognitive skills is contingent on cognitive skills or human capital in general. The completion of formal education is a quintessential form of human capital. The aim of this study is to test whether formal education indeed facilitates the improvement of non-cognitive skills during early adulthood and adulthood.] Methods I used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. The study sample consists of 9291 individuals, representative of U.S. adolescents in grades 7 through 12 in 1994. The longitudinal design of the data allowed the repeated measurement of their non-cognitive skills in adolescence (age 25). I used Latent Score Difference modeling to examine whether advancement in formal education through degree completion predicts within-individual change in non-cognitive skills in early adulthood and adulthood. Results A steady increase in non-cognitive skills beyond adolescence was found. Independently of academic engagement during high school, parental socio-economic status, and adolescent non-cognitive skills, degree completion reported in early adulthood coincides with gains in non-cognitive skills since adolescence, and this positive feedback repeats itself in adulthood. Conclusions Continued schooling facilitates personality maturation beyond adolescence. Given the profound effects of non-cognitive skills on various life outcomes, educational opportunities could alleviate social stratification.","Education, Personality, Adolescence, Life course, Longitudinal analysis","",""

A sample of 1196 adolescents completed a battery of self-report questionnaires measuring mindfulness, rumination, self-control and sleep quality as well as demographic information. Results showed that, in addition to the negative link between mindfulness and poor sleep quality, mindfulness was negatively associated with rumination, which in turn was positively associated with poor sleep quality. The direct link between mindfulness and poor sleep quality and the indirect link through rumination were both moderated by self-control. These two effects were stronger for adolescents with low self-control than for those with high self-control. These results coincide with the antagonistic interaction hypothesis of the protective-protective model, and indicate that mindfulness and self-control, as two important protective factors of adolescents, may mutually compensate.

Academic performance has been shown to have an indirect effect on the relationship between child maltreatment and deviant behavior. However, not all adolescents who have been maltreated engage in deviant behavior, so the relationship between child maltreatment and deviant behavior has remained unclear. Objective The aim of this research was to examine the potential mediating and/or moderating effects of academic performance on the relationship between child maltreatment and deviant behavior. Participants and setting The data in this study were from a nationwide study examining the consequences of childhood maltreatment in Taiwan. The database consisted of data from 2321 adolescents. Methods A secondary data analysis was conducted. Self-report data were obtained on childhood maltreatment experiences, academic performance, and deviant behaviors. Path analyses and a generalized linear model were used to examine the effects of academic performance on the relationship between child maltreatment and deviant behavior. Results Most participants were male (61.4%), with a mean age of 15.9 years. The mean scores of self-rated academic performance and deviant behavior were 2.86 and 8.2, respectively. A total of 83% participants reported having experienced childhood maltreatment. In this study, academic performance was found to have a moderating rather than a mediating effect on the relationship between child maltreatment and deviant behavior. Among adolescents who had been maltreated during childhood, those who self-rated poorer academic performance were more likely to have a higher deviant behavior score than those who self-rated better academic performance. Conclusions Good academic performance can be a buffer that reduces the risk of deviant behavior among individuals with a history of childhood maltreatment. Healthcare professionals and educators can tailor early prevention and intervention educational programs targeted toward adolescents with experience of childhood abuse or poor academic performance to prevent the incidence of deviant behavior and thus break the cycle of violence.","Academic performance, Child maltreatment, Deviant behavior","",""

Measures of inhibitory control and updating were administered to 115 participants across 2 days. One week later saturated fat intake and fruit and vegetable consumption were measured. Regression analyses revealed a double dissociation effect between the different executive function variables and the prediction of eating behaviours. Specifically, inhibitory control, but not updating, predict saturated fat intake, whilst updating, but not inhibitory control, was related to fruit and vegetable consumption. In both cases, better executive function capacity was associated with healthier eating behaviour. The results support the idea that behaviours that require stopping a response such as limiting saturated fat intake, have different determinants to those that require the initiation of a response such as fruit and vegetable consumption.

Three personality traits that conceptually relate to long-term goal pursuits and that have been linked to achievement outside sport are conscientiousness, self-control, and grit. This investigation examined how conscientiousness, alone (Study 1) and compared to self-control and grit (Study 2), explained criteria related to sport expertise development. Athletes (N = 270, 125 female, Mage = 21.27, SD = 6.91) ranging in skill level (local to international) completed surveys for personality, deliberate practice (DP), engagement in practice contexts (mandatory and optional), and threats to commitment (thoughts about quitting or switching out of one's sport). In Study 1, broad conscientiousness predicted engagement in both contexts of practice and fewer threats to commitment. At the facet-level, achievement-striving was the best predictor of DP and engagement in practice contexts. No conscientiousness facets predicted threats to commitment or higher skill group membership. In the comparative analyses between facets of conscientiousness, self-control, and grit (Study 2), grit variables performed best: perseverance of effort explained deliberate practice and higher skill group membership and consistency of interests associated with less thoughts of quitting/switching out of sport. Achievement-striving, dutifulness and self-discipline also showed effects associated with key criteria. These findings suggest, for example, that screening for perseverance of effort may help talent selectors identify which athletes have a personality advantage to persevere through the highly effortful conditions of DP.

In doing this, we shed light on relevant methodological considerations and directions for future research.","Biases, Choice architecture, Field study, Heuristics, Intervention, Nudging, Proof implementation, Proof of concept, Proof of principle","","Woodhead Publishing Series in Food Science, Technology and Nutrition"

The Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry Concept represents an attempt to deconstruct some of these paradoxes. In this paper, we relate admiration and rivalry to the personality metatraits, i.e., Plasticity and Stability, in an attempt to demonstrate that the metatrait concept offers an interesting way of framing why admiration seems to be profitable for individuals, whilst rivalry appears to have a net cost. Based on previous studies, we examined how admiration and rivalry were related to self-esteem, impulsivity and personality traits in two prospective studies involving a total of 719 adults. Our results are consistent with those of Back et al. (2013). Additionally, we demonstrated that admiration is composed of extraversion and openness to experience, thus representing the Plasticity (Beta) metatrait, and rivalry is composed of agreeableness, emotional stability and conscientiousness and thus corresponds to the Stability (Alpha) metatrait. In the terminology of the circumplex model of personality metatraits, rivalry can be conceived as the opposite of Stability: Alpha-minus. We suggest that rather than being disagreeable extraverts, narcissists are Unstable Plastics.","Narcissism, Admiration, Rivalry, Personality metatraits","",""

Multilevel data collected across two weeks from 155 employees located in urban China indicate that appraisals of air pollution severity deplete employees’ self-control resources. This depletion in turn mediates the effects of air pollution appraisals on employee behavior, resulting in decreased organizational citizenship behavior and increased counterproductive work behavior. In support of the depletion perspective, the effects of air pollution appraisals are moderated by employees’ trait self-control, and hold even after controlling for employees’ daily negative affectivity and objective levels of air pollution.

While ruling out alternative explanations, they furthermore supported the mediating role of ascribing targets control over their mental states. Studies 3a-3b provided correlational evidence of the perceived ability to control one's own mental states as a mechanism in the relationship between TSC and ascriptions of control to others. Studies 4a-4b followed a causal-chain experimental approach: A manipulation of participants' self-perceived ability to control their emotions impacted their control ascriptions to others over their immoral mental states (Study 4a), and targets perceived as high (vs. low) in control over their immoral mental states elicited stronger moralizing reactions. Taken together, the present studies elucidate why people moralize others' purely mental states, even in the absence of overt behavior.

Measures included hedonic hunger assessed with the Power of Food Scale (PFS), the short form Self-Control Scale, overeating frequency, snacking frequency, intake of high-fat salty snack foods, and intake of high-sugar foods assessed with a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Higher scores on the PFS and lower self-control capacities were correlated with higher intakes of both high-fat salty snack foods and high-sugar foods (referred to here as palatable foods), higher overeating frequency and higher snacking frequency. Four separate moderation analyses revealed that the positive associations of hedonic hunger with overeating frequency, snacking frequency and palatable food intake were significantly attenuated by self-control. Results of the present study indicate that people who are highly sensitive to the ready availability of palatable foods but also have high levels of self-control exhibit less frequent overeating and snacking, including less frequent intake of unhealthy palatable foods, than those low in self-control. Consequently, self-control may prevent overeating and thus may serve as a protective factor that decreases the risk of becoming overweight in individuals who are highly sensitive to the food environment.","","",""

One of the most prevalent risky mobile phone use behaviours is texting while driving. Attempts to explain texting while driving suggest cognitive variables and personality characteristics are key factors. This study explored relationships between trait self-regulation, habitual text messaging, trait mindfulness, and texting while driving. One hundred and seventy participants comprising Australian undergraduate psychology students and members of the public completed an online survey measuring trait self-regulation, habitual text messaging behaviour, trait mindfulness, and frequency of texting while driving. It was found that habitual texting behaviour mediated the relationship between trait self-regulation and frequency of texting while driving. Additionally, trait mindfulness moderated the relationship between habit and texting while driving, such that habitual texting was significantly, positively related to texting while driving, but only for individuals with low to moderate trait mindfulness. These results suggest personality constructs related to attention, awareness, and control of behaviour play a significant role in counteracting the association that habitual texting behaviour has with the frequency of texting while driving. As these traits are considered malleable, this association may be applicable in future development of intervention programs aimed at increasing control over mobile phone use and reducing the frequency with which people text while driving.","Driving, Habit, Mindfulness, Mobile phone, Self-regulation, Texting","",""

Design Systematic review informed by the PRISMA guidelines. Method Literature was sourced from Science Direct, Sport Discus, Psycharticles and Psychinfo. This was followed by a detailed screening and sifting process to identify literature. Identified literature was independently appraised by multiple reviewers using the mixed-methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). Data was represented using concept mapping. Results Forty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. They investigated a cumulative 14,977 participants and gleaned 48 psychosocial factors associated with talent development in football. Findings suggest that social and psychological factors are interrelated and influence adaptive developmental behaviours (e.g., adaptive lifestyle choices, practice and play behaviours). These can influence coach perceptions of players and whether they may recommend players for career progression. Independent MMAT appraisal demonstrated a moderate risk of bias. Female football players and female coaches are significantly under-represented in the literature; with white, adolescent, able-bodied, male European football players dominating the literature. Descriptive, cross-sectional, correlational and retrospective designs are most commonly adopted in the literature. Conclusions Psychosocial factors can differentiate between performance levels of football or are positively associated with career progression to a senior elite level in football, however findings should be viewed with caution due to a moderate risk of bias in reporting. The research area would be advanced by diversification of participant groups, longitudinal, prospective designs, and by testing the predictive validity of existing grounded theories.","Talent development, Football, Psychosocial factors, MMAT, Concept mapping, Sport psychology","",""

However, little is known about the potential mechanisms of the effect from child maltreatment to internalized/externalized aggression. Objective Based on the perspectives of social comparison and the general aggression model, the present study examined the mediating effects of benign envy, malicious envy and self-control between child maltreatment and internalized/externalized aggression. Participants and setting 1951 adolescents (49 % girls, Mage = 12.93 years, SD = 2.54) from mainland China were recruited. Methods Based on the retrospective self-reporting of five questionnaires, structural equation modeling and bootstrap estimation procedure were adopted to identify the mediating effects of benign envy, malicious envy and self-control. Results The structural model fitted well [χ2 (178, 1951) = 1601.176, p < .001; RMSEA = 0.064; SRMR = 0.076; CFI = 0.913]. Benign envy (95 % CI [0.013, 0.002], [−0.040, −0.079]), malicious envy (95 % CI [0.044, 0.024], [0.363, 0.241]) and self-control (95 % CI [0.025, 0.005], [0.264, 0.166]) played a significant mediating role between child maltreatment and internalized/externalized aggression. Conclusion Benign envy, malicious envy and self-control played an important mediating role between child maltreatment and internalized/externalized aggression, which may provide a theoretical basis for future interventions to reduce adolescent problem behaviors, paying more attention to the improvement of emotion regulation and self-control.","Child maltreatment, Internalized aggression, Externalized aggression, Benign envy, Malicious envy, Self-control","",""

Such works have consistently found that perceived addiction is related to concerning outcomes such as psychological distress, relational distress, and other addictive behaviors. However, very little work has specifically examined whether or not perceived addiction is actually related to increased use of pornography, cross-sectionally or over time. The present work sought to address this deficit in the literature. Using two longitudinal samples (Sample 1, Baseline N = 3988; Sample 2, Baseline N = 1047), a variety of factors (e.g., male gender, lower religiousness, and lower self-control) were found to predict any use of pornography. Among those that acknowledged use (Sample 1, Baseline N = 1352; Sample 2, Baseline N = 793), perceived addiction to pornography consistently predicted greater average daily use of pornography. At subsequent longitudinal follow-ups (Sample 1, Baseline N = 265; Sample 2, One Month Later, N = 410, One Year Later, N = 360), only male gender and baseline average pornography use consistently predicted future use. These findings suggest that perceived addiction to pornography is associated with concurrent use of pornography, but does not appear to predict use over time, suggesting that perceived addiction may not always be an accurate indicator of behavior or addiction.","Pornography, Technology, Addiction, Longitudinal, Perception, Religion","",""

Without disputing their importance, these foci fail to capture many of the fluctuating, conflicting forces that are readily apparent when people navigate the environment and social world. In this paper, we review literature to offer evidence for the prominence of psychological flexibility in understanding psychological health. Thus far, the importance of psychological flexibility has been obscured by the isolation and disconnection of research conducted on this topic. Psychological flexibility spans a wide range of human abilities to: recognize and adapt to various situational demands; shift mindsets or behavioral repertoires when these strategies compromise personal or social functioning; maintain balance among important life domains; and be aware, open, and committed to behaviors that are congruent with deeply held values. In many forms of psychopathology, these flexibility processes are absent. In hopes of creating a more coherent understanding, we synthesize work in emotion regulation, mindfulness and acceptance, social and personality psychology, and neuropsychology. Basic research findings provide insight into the nature, correlates, and consequences of psychological flexibility and applied research provides details on promising interventions. Throughout, we emphasize dynamic approaches that might capture this fluid construct in the real-world.","Flexibility, Self-regulation, Emotion regulation, Mindfulness, Resilience, Vulnerability","Positive Clinical Psychology",""

Sixth through eighth graders in rural China (n=815, mean age=12.55years) reported on harsh parenting, effortful control, and classroom engagement. Parents also reported on each other's harsh parenting. Academic achievement was assessed by students' test scores and teacher-rated academic performance. Results of structural equation modeling revealed gender differences in patterns of association among the model variables. Harsh parenting was negatively and directly associated with academic achievement for both boys and girls. It was also negatively and indirectly associated with academic achievement via effortful control and classroom engagement sequentially, forming a common indirect “path” for boys and girls. The indirect negative effect of harsh parenting on boys' academic achievement was mainly realized through the mediator of effortful control, whereas this same indirect effect for girls was mainly realized through the mediator of classroom engagement. Jointly, effortful control and classroom engagement precipitates more indirect effects for boys than for girls in the association between harsh parenting and academic achievement. The discussion analyzes the potential “paths” from harsh parenting to adolescent academic achievement, as well as gender differences in these “paths.” The current study has implications for teachers and parents eager to improve students' classroom engagement and academic achievement.","Harsh parenting, Academic achievement, Effortful control, Classroom engagement","",""

We rely on an ego-depletion manipulation which consumes self-control resources, thereby enhancing the influence of default reactions, or in psychological terms, automatic processes. Experimental results provide evidence that proposers make higher offers under ego depletion. Based on findings from a closely related dictator game study, which shows that depleted dictators give less than non-depleted ones, we discard the possibility that other-regarding concerns are the default mode. Instead, we conclude that depleted proposers offer more because of a strategic ‘fear of rejection’ of low offers, consistent with self-centered monetary concerns. For responders, ego depletion increases the likelihood to accept offers, in line with unconditional monetary concerns being more automatic than affect-influenced reactions to reject unfair offers.","Ultimatum game, Self-control, Ego depletion, Social preferences","",""

Method Surveys were conducted with a nationally representative sample of young adults ages 18–32, drawn from the AmeriSpeak panel, a probability-based panel with coverage of 97% of U.S. households. The weighted study sample is 2284 young adult respondents, of whom 1561 reported being in an intimate partnership. Results Rates of verbal aggression perpetrated by young adults declined with the intimacy of the relationship, such that aggression against a partner (72%) exceeded aggression directed at friends (43%) and strangers (34%). Similar rates of physical violence (about 9%) were reportedly perpetrated against partners, friends, and strangers. Adjusting for a range of personal characteristics, both adverse childhood experiences and recent stressors in these young adult lives exhibited direct associations with verbal and physically aggressive outcomes. Conclusions In models of verbal and physical aggression across relationship contexts, childhood adversity exhibits lasting effects unaccounted for by important proximal life circumstances, including recent life stressors, mental health, and substance use behaviors. These results provide empirical insights for clinical treatment of young adults prone to aggressive conflicts as well as input to positive youth development programming to foster healthy approaches to conflict.","Verbal aggression, Physical violence, Intimate partner violence, Young adult relationships, Adverse childhood experiences, Life stressors, Interpersonal conflict","",""

Supporting hypotheses, findings indicated that individuals high in self-control reported less affect in their daily lives, were more consistent in their traits, and were viewed as less spontaneous and extraverted by informants.

These theoretical perspectives may both be relevant if psychopathy is understood as a dimensional construct, with primary psychopathy the consequence of a neurological vulnerability to emotional deficits, and secondary psychopathy reflecting an environmental adaptation and subsequent failure of self-control. Using a non-clinical sample (n=479), this study examined the relationship between sub-clinical psychopathic traits, self-control and the identification of facial emotion.

Progress has been made by discarding outmoded philosophical notions in favor of exploring how ordinary people understand and use the notion of free will. The concept of responsible autonomy captures many aspects of layperson concepts of free will, including acting on one's own (i.e., not driven by external forces), choosing, using reasons and personal values, conscious reflection, and knowing and accepting consequences and moral implications. Free will can thus be understood as form of volition (action control) that evolved to enable people to live in cultural societies. Much work has shown that belief in free will (as opposed to disbelief) is associated with actions that are conducive to functioning well in culture, including helpfulness, restraint of aggression, learning via counterfactual analysis, thinking for oneself, effective job performance, and appropriate gratitude. Belief in free will increases in response to misdeeds by others, thus emphasizing the link to personal responsibility. Research on volition indicates that self-regulation, intelligent reasoning, decision making, and initiative all deplete a (common) limited energy source, akin to the folk notion of willpower and linked to the body's glucose supplies. Free will is thus not an absolute or constant property of persons but a variable, fluctuating capability—one that is nonetheless highly adaptive for individuals and society. The notion that people have free will has been invoked in multiple contexts. Legally and morally, it explains why people can be held responsible for their actions. Theologically, it was used to explain why a supposedly kind and omniscient god would send most of the people he created to hell (Walker, 1964). Yet, for such an important concept, there remains wide-ranging disagreement and confusion over its existence and its nature. For example, philosophers still debate whether humans truly have free will and, if so, under what conditions human volition deserves to be considered free (Kane, 2011). In psychology, most theorists believe that humans engage in self-control, rational choice, planning, initiative, and related acts of volition. The debate is not whether these things occur but merely whether these should be called free will. This chapter will provide an overview of recent psychology experiments concerned with free will. There are three main and quite distinct sets of problems, each with associated lines of research. The first is concerned with how people understand the idea of free will. The second concerns the causes and consequences of believing in free will. The third focuses on the actual volitional processes that guide human action.","Free will, Volition, Self-regulation, Decision making, Depletion","","Advances in Experimental Social Psychology"

The adolescents’ parents were randomly placed into either an intervention group or a control group. Members of the intervention group participated in seven sessions of parent training, which aimed to increase behaviors associated with an authoritative parenting style. Findings show that participants in the parent training program displayed an increase in authoritative parenting behaviors and a decrease in authoritarian and neglectful parenting behaviors at both posttest and follow-up. In addition, their children showed reductions in parent-reported challenging behaviors. Declines in challenging behaviors were explained by increases in authoritative parenting behaviors, although not all intervention effects could be explained by such increases.

In parallel with this theoretical distinction, implicit measures appear to be a good candidate for measuring aggression and predicting aggressive behavior. Although consideration of automatic processes is essential for a better understanding of how and why people act aggressively, it should not lead to the conclusion that aggressive behavior is fully automatic.

People induced to disbelieve in free will show impulsive and antisocial tendencies, suggesting a reduction of the willingness to exert self-control. We investigated whether undermining free will affects two aspects of self-control: intentional inhibition and perceived self-control. We exposed participants either to anti-free will or to neutral messages. The two groups (no-free will and control) then performed a task that required self-control to inhibit a prepotent response. No-free will participants showed less intentional inhibitions than controls, suggesting a reduction of self-control. We assessed perceived self-control by asking participants whether the response resulted from a deliberate intention or from an impulsive reaction. Perceived self-control was lower in the no-free will group than in control group. Our findings show that undermining free will can degrade self-control and provide insights into how disbelieving in free will leads to antisocial tendencies.","Free will, Inhibition, Intention, Motor control, Intentionality, Self-control, Belief","",""
