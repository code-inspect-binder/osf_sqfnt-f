In previous studies these objects were always external to the agent. However, relevant knowledge of self is also potentially accessible during goal pursuit, as self-esteem is an indicator of aim’s feasibility. In two experimental studies we tested whether goal activation affects temporal changes in automatic evaluations of personality traits related to the dimensions of agency and communion. We administered affect misattribution procedure where participants rated neutral Chinese hexagrams proceeded by words describing traits (75 ms masked presentation). The list of words comprised agentic (e.g. agile) and communal (e.g. trustworthy) traits. The rating took place twice—before and after introducing a manual task. In the first study, goal activation led to slightly more positive implicit evaluations of agentic and more negative evaluation of communal traits, which is consistent with empirical data on self-perception depending on agentic knowledge rather than communal one. In the second study we showed that goal activation led to changes only for promotion-, but not prevention-oriented individuals, which is explained by motivation strength. The results indicate that valuation of traits changes temporarily along with goal pursuit.

The descriptive statistics and reliability estimates of the SCMS were replicated in the current sample. In terms of construct validity, convergent validity was obtained with mindfulness, positive affect, negative affect, life satisfaction, depression, stress, and anxiety. Likewise, discriminant construct validity was obtained with social desirability, irrational beliefs, and anxiety sensitivity. Furthermore, the three-factor structure of the SCMS was supported by a confirmatory factor analysis.

When the above article was first published online, the words 'Divine struggles' in the beginning of the title were missing. This has now been corrected in both the print and online versions of the article.] Many people experience divine struggle—negative thoughts or feelings about God. This study examined connections between divine struggle (anger toward God; concern about God's disapproval), body image concerns, binge eating, and compensatory behaviours (purging, fasting, exercise) among undergraduates (N = 413; 47% women). Measures of divine struggle showed weak, inconsistent links with binge eating but consistent positive links with body image concerns and compensatory behaviours. These associations were not moderated by gender and remained significant when controlling 16 relevant variables (e.g., personality, self-concept, depression, religiousness). Body image/eating variables explained 9–11% of variance in current divine struggles. Binging correlated positively with protest and anger suppression toward God but also with approach behaviours. Compensatory behaviours correlated positively with protest, disengagement, and anger suppression. Spiritual grandiosity – seeing oneself as having a special/superior relationship with God – predicted more compensatory behaviours. Some nonbelievers also reported divine struggles, and these were associated with body image/eating disturbances.

(2) What is the evidence for their effectiveness within such settings? (3) What implementation issues arise when transporting EBPs into RCS? Methods: Evidence-based psychosocial interventions and respective outcome studies, published from 1990 to 2012, were identified through a multi-phase search process, involving the review of four major clearinghouse websites and relevant electronic databases. To be included, effectiveness had to have been previously established through a comparison group design regardless of the setting, and interventions tested subsequently with youth in RCS. All outcome studies were evaluated for quality and bias using a structured appraisal tool. Results: Ten interventions matching a priori criteria were identified: Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach, Aggression Replacement Training, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, Ecologically-Based Family Therapy, Eye Movement and Desensitization Therapy, Functional Family Therapy, Multimodal Substance Abuse Prevention, Residential Student Assistance Program, Solution-Focused Brief Therapy, and Trauma Intervention Program for Adjudicated and At-Risk Youth. Interventions were tested in 13 studies, which were conducted in different types of RCS, using a variety of study methods. Outcomes were generally positive, establishing the relative effectiveness of the interventions with youth in RCS across a range of psychosocial outcomes. However, concerns about methodological bias and confounding factors remain. Most studies addressed implementation issues, reporting on treatment adaptations, training and supervision, treatment fidelity and implementation barriers. Conclusion: The review unearthed a small but important body of knowledge that demonstrates that EBPs can be implemented in RCS with encouraging results.

It is widely believed that these processes are critical to self‐control and, therefore, that performance on behavioural task measures of EF should be associated with individual differences in everyday life outcomes. The purpose of the present study was to test this assumption, focusing on the core executive function facet of inhibition. A sample of 463 undergraduates completed five laboratory inhibition tasks, along with three self‐report measures of self‐control and 28 self‐report measures of life outcomes. Results showed that although most of the life outcome measures were associated with self‐reported self‐control, only one of the outcomes was associated with inhibition task performance at the latent‐variable level, and this association was in the unexpected direction. Furthermore, few associations were found at the individual task level. These findings challenge the criterion validity of lab‐based inhibition tasks. More generally, when considered alongside the known lack of convergent validity between inhibition tasks and self‐report measures of self‐control, the findings cast doubt on the task's construct validity as measures of self‐control processes. Potential methodological and theoretical reasons for the poor performance of laboratory‐based inhibition tasks are discussed.

The authors developed and refined a short 9-item measure of perceived addiction to Internet pornography, confirmed its structure in multiple samples, examined its relatedness to hypersexuality more broadly, and demonstrated that the notion of perceived addiction to Internet pornography is very robustly related to various measures of psychological distress. Furthermore, the relation between psychological distress and the new measure persisted, even when other potential contributors (e.g., neuroticism, self-control, amount of time spent viewing pornography) were controlled for statistically, indicating the clinical relevance of assessing perceived addiction to Internet pornography.

Our focus is on the agent and how self‐regulatory resources influence sexual objectification. Consistent with prior evidence, we reasoned that people have a well‐learned automatic response to objectify sexualized women, and as such, we expected objectifying a sexualized (vs. personalized) woman would deplete fewer regulatory resources than not objectifying her. Findings across three studies confirmed our expectations, demonstrating the extent to which people objectify a sexualized woman or not is influenced by the availability of regulatory resources, a case that heretofore has been absent from the literature.

Aim: To investigate the extent to which self-control is a component of resident professionalism, rated both by residents and their program directors. Methods: 366 residents in 13 residency programs were invited to participate in a survey study of professionalism. Participating residents completed the Professionalism—Documentation of Competence (ProDOC) (a 15-item measure of professionalism developed for the study), a 10-item version of the Marlowe–Crowne Social Desirability Scale, and the Brief Self-Control Scale. Independently, program directors of participating residents completed the ProDOC with reference to each of their participating residents. Results: 215 residents agreed to participate in the study (58.7% response rate). Resident ProDOC scores were significantly related to social desirability and self-control. Self-control alone accounted for approximately 25% of the variance in resident ProDOC scores, and approximately 17% of the variance in ProDOC scores when shared variance with social desirability was controlled. There was no correlation between resident and program director ProDOC scores. Conclusions: Self-control is an important facet of human behavior and interpersonal interaction, including the behaviors that constitute medical professionalism. The lack of correlation between residents’ self-ratings of professionalism and their program directors’ ratings underscores the difficulty in understanding and measuring this competency.

The results revealed that higher self-control was related to fewer mental and physical health symptoms and less avoidance coping. There was not a significant relationship between self-control and problem-focused or emotion-focused coping styles. Further, the relationships between self-control and mental and physical health outcomes were partially mediated by avoidance coping style. Specifically, the data suggest lower self-control is associated with unhealthy coping strategies (avoidance coping), which in turn are associated with worse mental health outcomes and greater reports of physical health symptoms. Thus lower trait self-control can serve as an indicator, suggesting circumstances in which individuals’ tendencies to engage in unhealthy coping strategies are increased.

Nevertheless, no general adult self-report instrument has been developed to measure this important construct. The 16-item Self-Control and Self-Management Scale (SCMS) was developed as a new adult self-report instrument designed to be a general trait measure of SCMSk. In Study 1, the item pool was generated and revised based on the current literature and feedback from content validity experts. In Study 2, based on responses from a multiethnic student sample (n = 302), factor analytic procedures and rational item selection were used to produce a reliable and construct valid instrument. The findings of both studies support the further evaluation of the SCMS as a research and applied instrument, and suggest its potential current use in student and counseling settings given obtained relationships with anxiety, depression, and weight-management competencies.
